# Changelog

## Changed in v23

* Added the one-time profession masters to the progression knowledge group. (*Also* mostly missing questids, for the same reason.)
* Improved the check for profession levels - it previously required that the trade skill UI had been opened in that login session before it was reliable; now it'll *mostly* work
* Added questids for profession knowledge in Inscription, Jewelcrafting, Mining, and Herbalism (thanks again to Marthammor!)
* Added two missing profession knowledge treasures
* Added the Temperamental Skyclaw mount in Azure Span
* Adding some rares and loot across zones

## Changed in v22

* [Profession knowledge treasures](https://www.wowhead.com/guide/professions/knowledge-point-treasure-locations-dragon-isles) have been added, thanks to Marthammor!
	* They mostly still need questids added, so they won't disappear when you collect them... but expect that in another few days. Getting a character through with every single crafting profession is a pain, who knew?
* Added missing loot to some achievement treasures that wasn't implemented in beta
* Dragon race tooltips now show your best times and general loot-rewards from the achievements
